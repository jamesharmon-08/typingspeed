# typingspeed

A GUI typing speed test.  User will type a paragraph that is displayed on the screen and it will display the results of the test.
It will give the user a net WPM score.

The GUI is implemented with TKinter.  I believe TKinter is default install with python3.

I learned how to time user once they begin to type.  I learned keyboard event <KeyPress> and how to ignore non-displayable characters.
I will be adding a paragraph file so that it will randomly give user different things to type.
